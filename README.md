# Password Generator

This Python script generates a random password based on the user's specifications.

## Usage

1. **Run the Script**: Execute the Python script `password_generator.py` using a Python interpreter.

2. **Input Password Length**: The script prompts the user to input the desired length of the password. If no input is provided, the default length is set to 8 characters.

3. **Generated Password**: Once the length is specified, the script generates a random password consisting of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols.

4. **Output**: The generated password is printed to the console.

## Dependencies

This script requires no external dependencies. It utilizes only the built-in `random` module in Python.

## Example

```bash
$ python password_generator.py
Enter the password length (default is 8): 12
Generated password: hS7@5&tF3L*p
```

## Note

It's recommended to ensure the generated password is securely stored or saved, as it's not stored or logged anywhere by the script.
